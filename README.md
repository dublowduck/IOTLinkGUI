# IOTLinkGUI
## What is IOTLinkGUI?
IOTLinkGUI is a Windows Forms GUI for controlling **[IOT Link](https://iotlink.gitlab.io/)**, a program for conecting Windows to **[MQTT](https://mqtt.org/)** and **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)**.

## Is this official?
No

IOTLinkGUI is in no way affiliated to IOT Link. I am an independent developer. I just think it's cool.

## Why does IOT Link need a GUI?

It doesn't really. I'm learning Windows development and wanted to build a real application that other people could use. This seemed like a good idea because IOT Link doesn't have a GUI (as far as I know) and I thought it would be simple enough to make one.
